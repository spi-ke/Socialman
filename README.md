Silex Bootstrap
===============

[ ![Codeship Status for spi-ke/Socialman](https://www.codeship.io/projects/90b3bbb0-0d3b-0132-bc90-6a1e79364744/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/32286)

[![Build Status][]](https://travis-ci.org/herrera-io/php-silex-bootstrap)

This is a pre-made web application built on the [Silex][] micro-framework and
the [Bootstrap][] front-end framework. The web application is ready to launch
and requires minor alterations to get a new project up and running. I suggest
acquiring a solid understanding of Silex and Bootstrap before proceeding.

To create a new project, run:

```
$ composer create-project herrera-io/silex-bootstrap myProject/
```

Configuration
-------------

### Locations

First, you need to know that parameters, services, and routes are configured
by using [YAML][] configuration files. These files are loaded through the
[`WiseServiceProvider`][] service provider in the default environment, `prod`:

> If you know how the service provider works, you will also know that you can
> completely change the file format used. Instead of using YAML, you can use
> JSON, XML, INI, or just plain PHP. YAML was used since most of this bootstrap
> project is already based on Symfony, which heavily uses YAML.

| What       | Where                       |
| ----------:|:--------------------------- |
| parameters | `app/config/parameters.yml` |
| services   | `app/config/services.yml`   |
| routes     | `app/config/routes.yml`     |

For all other environments that are not named `prod`, configuration files will
have the name of their environment appended to the end of them, but before the
file extension:

| What       | Where                         |
| ----------:|:----------------------------- |
| parameters | `app/config/parameters_*.yml` |
| services   | `app/config/services_*.yml`   |
| routes     | `app/config/routes_*.yml`     |

### Environments

The active environment is controlled by the `APP_MODE` environment variable.
When the variable is not set, the default value of `prod` is used. Currently,
the web application only recognizes three environments:

- `prod` &mdash; Used for live, production web applications.
- `dev` &mdash; Used for debugging the web application.
- `test` &mdash; Used for running `PHPUnit` test suites.

If you intend to use `dev`, `test`, or any other mode intended for debugging or
testing, you will also want to set the `APP_DEBUG` variable to `1` (one). This
will enable debugging mode in Silex.

### Configuring

The `parameters.yml` file defines the application-wide parameters that are
set directly in the Silex instance. Because of how parameters are set in Silex,
you must be careful not to accidentally replace services that use the same name
as one or more of your parameters.

Once the application-wide parameters have been loaded and set, services are
registered from `services.yml`, followed by the routes in `routes.yml`. To
understand how these are configured, you must read up on the documentation
for the [`WiseServiceProvider`][].

### Defaults

These are the services registered by default:

- `Silex\Provider\FormServiceProvider`
- `Silex\Provider\MonologServiceProvider`
- `Silex\Provider\SessionServiceProvider`
- [`Herrera\Silex\Provider\TranslationServiceProvider`][]
- `Silex\Provider\TwigServiceProvider`
- `Silex\Provider\UrlGeneratorServiceProvider`
- `Silex\Provider\ValidatorServiceProvider`

The following services are also registered when the `dev` environment is used:

- `Silex\Provider\ServiceControllerServiceProvider`
- `Silex\Provider\WebProfilerServiceProvider`

The `test` environment will actually unregister the `WebProfilerServiceProvider`.

### Customizing

The `Herrera\Silex\Application` class uses three methods for loading parameters,
services, and routes. These methods can be replaced or extended if configuring
through files is found to be inadequate.

- `registerDefaultParameters()` &mdash; Loads the parameters.
- `registerDefaultServices()` &mdash; Loads the services.
- `registerDefaultRoutes()` &mdash; Loads the routes.

It is likely that you will find that you cannot properly register one or more
services through a configuration file. For cases such as these, you will want
to do something like the following in your own `Application` subclass:

```php
use Herrera\Silex\Application;

/**
 * My custom version of the bootstrap application class.
 *
 * @author Example User <example@user.com>
 */
class MyApplication extends Application
{
    /**
     * {@override}
     */
    protected function registerDefaultServices()
    {
        parent::registerDefaultServices();

        // my custom registrations
    }
}
```

> You may also just modify the application class in
> `src/lib/Herrera/Silex/Application`, instead of creating a new subclass.
> This may be more convenient for you, but it could complicate maintenance
> when updates are released to this project.

If you create your own subclass, you will need to modify a few instances where
the original class is used:

1. In `src/lib/Herrera/Silex/Test/TestCase.php`, you will need to modify the
   `TestCase->createApplication()` method so that it returns an instance of
   your class, instead of the default one.
1. In `web/index.php`, you will need to modify the call to the method
   `Herrera\Silex\Application::create()` so that it calls the same method on
   your class: `Example\Subclass::create()`

Console
-------

The web application provides console support through the [Go][] build tool.
You can add, edit, and remove your own tasks by editing the `Gofile` in the
root directory.

These are the default tasks:

| Command             | Description                                              |
| -------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app:clear`         | Removes the contents of `app/cache` and `app/logs`.      |
| `app:clear:cache`   | Removes the contents of `app/cache`.                     |
| `app:clear:logs`    | Removes the contents of `app/logs`.                      |
| `app:generate:docs` | Uses [Sami][] to generate API documentation.             |
| `app:minify`        | Uses [Minify][] to minify JS and CSS assets.             |
| `app:run`           | Runs your web application using the [built-in server][]. |
| `app:test`          | Uses [PHPUnit][] to execute the test suite.              |

### Sami

By default, the Sami settings are in `app/config/docs.php`. Sami is configured
so that the parsed data is stored in `app/cache/docs`, while the final rendered
result is stored in `docs/` in the root directory.

To generate the API documentation:

```
$ bin/go app:docs
```

### Minify

By default, the list of assets to minify is in `app/config/assets.yml`. The
file is organized as an associative array. The key is the path where the
minified file will be saved, and the value is an array of paths that will be
minified.

To minify assets:

```
$ bin/go app:minify
```

### PHPUnit

By default, the test cases are kept in `src/tests`. PHPUnit is also configured
to automatically load classes from that directory if they are not present in
the `src/lib` directory.

To launch PHPUnit:

```
$ bin/go app:test
```

To generate code coverage, simply pass the option `--coverage` (or `-c`). The
task will take care of configuring PHPUnit so that the generated HTML coverage
report is stored in `app/cache/coverage`.

Translations
------------

By default, translation files are stored in `app/translations`. Also by default,
the following translation files are registered with the translation service
provider:

- `example.de.yml`
- `example.en.yml`
- `example.fr.yml`

To use your own translation files, I recommend reading the documentation on the
`TranslationServiceProvider` service provider. The service provider will allow
you do other things such as specify which loader class you need to register in
order to load your translation files. This means you can use other formats,
such as XLIFF, instead of YAML.

Front-End
---------

The front-end is built using the following:

- Bootstrap 2.3.2
- [Font Awesome][] 3.2.1
- jQuery 1.10.2
- [jQuery Migrate][] 1.2.1
- [Twig][] 1.9+

A custom form theme has also been supplied to make using the horizontal form
design very simple to use. All form types recognized by Bootstrap are supported
by the theme.

```twig
{% extends "layout.html.twig" %}

{% form_theme myForm "form.html.twig" %}

{% block content %}
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span5 pull-both">
          <h1 class="page-header">Example Form</h1>
          {{ form(form) }}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
```
